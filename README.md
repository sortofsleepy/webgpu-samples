just different webgpu experiments - mostly derived from existing code. 

* [https://github.com/austinEng/webgpu-samples](https://github.com/austinEng/webgpu-samples)

To Run 
===== 
You need a browser with a WebGPU implmentation available. At the time of this writing the best is either the [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/) or 
[Chrome canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)

After you download 
* In Chrome Canary you can find the setting behind chrome://flags
* Currently only works in Canary



Notes
===
* In safari, context string is just "gpu"
* In safari "setSubData" on GPUBuffer is not defined
